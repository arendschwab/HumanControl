To Do List
==========

- Move the pull force location parameters into the parameter text files instead
  of whipple_pull_force_abcd.
- Move all of the data generation into ieee.m (phase portrait stuff in particular).
- Add the new values for the Browserins instead of the old.
- Make the varargin_to_structure take the default structure and add the
  varargins to the default stucture. This may need to be done recursively.
- Make warnings if the gains don't converge
- Save correctly found kains to a file
- If gains didn't get found, give user the option to set them
