File Descriptions
=================
These files contain the parameter sets for several bicycles (with a rigid
rider) for the benchmark bicycle model as reported in [1] as a comma separated
list. The filename should follow this format '[bicycle short name]Par.txt'
where 'bicycle short name' is a capitalized one word name for the particular
parameter set, e.g. 'BenchmarkPar.txt'. The variable names inside the file must
follow the same format as the example files.
