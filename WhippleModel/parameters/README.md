File Descriptions
=================
These files contain the parameter sets for several bicycles (with a rigid
rider) for the benchmark bicycle model as reported in [1] as a comma separated
list. The filename should follow this format '[bicycle short name]Par.txt'
where 'bicycle short name' is a capitalized one word name for the particular
parameter set. The variable names inside the file must follow the same format
as the example files.
